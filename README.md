## Internals

<!-- !!! Undecided whether implementation will be in Go or JS....
This _esbuild_ plugin utilizes the [CycloneDX library][cyclonedx-(js|go)-library] to generate the actual data structures.
-->

 <!-- Besides the class `CycloneDxEsbuildPlugin` and the interface `CycloneDxEsbuildPluginOptions`,  -->
This _esbuild_ plugin does **not** expose any additional _public_ API or classes - all code is intended to be internal and might change without any notice during version upgrades.
